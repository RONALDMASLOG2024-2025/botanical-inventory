## ✅ Testing Checklist

After running migrations:

- [ ] Create new plant with inventory data
- [ ] Verify quantity field is required
- [ ] Set quantity to 0, check status becomes "Out of Stock"
- [ ] Set quantity below minimum, check status becomes "Low Stock"
- [ ] Set quantity above minimum, check status becomes "Available"
- [ ] View `low_stock_plants` to see alerts
- [ ] View `inventory_summary` for category totals
- [ ] Run `get_inventory_stats()` for overall numbers
- [ ] Update quantity, check `inventory_history` logged it
- [ ] Test character counter on inventory notes (1000 limit)
- [ ] Verify form blocks submission if inventory notes > 1000 chars

---

## 📞 Support

For questions or issues:
1. Check migration success messages
2. Verify all fields exist: `SELECT * FROM plants LIMIT 1;`
3. Test views: `SELECT * FROM low_stock_plants;`
4. Check constraints: `\d+ plants` (in psql)
